What tool should we use for them?\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- No additional costs\n- Easy to use\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- GitHub Action\n- Jenkins\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"GitHub Action\", because it meets with all criteria. We do not plan to change GitHub on something else for now - so the only cons is not affecting us at all.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### GitHub Action\n\n- Good, because free to use (with some limitations)\n- Good, because really easy to setup\n- Good, because there is a lot of community plugins\n- Bad, because we are more tied to GitHub\n\n### Jenkins\n\n- Good, because there is a lot of community plugins\n- Good, because we do not have to rewrite all pipelines in case of changing Git provider.\n- Bad, because it requires additional infrastructure costs"},"creationDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Crisperit","publicationDate":"2022-01-30T22:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"doc/decision/20220130-use-github-action-to-build-ci-cd.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/prappser_app/prappser_app/doc/decision/20220130-use-github-action-to-build-ci-cd.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/crisperit/prappser_app/blob/master/doc/decision/20220130-use-github-action-to-build-ci-cd.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
