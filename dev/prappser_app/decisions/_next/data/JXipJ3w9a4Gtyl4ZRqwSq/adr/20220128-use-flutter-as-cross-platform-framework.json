What would be the best option to consider for this project?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Do not take too many time for platform customizations\n- Performance\n- Easy to develop\n- Support for creating views from the JSON\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Flutter\n- React Native\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Flutter\", because of its ability to look almost the same on every platform and the overall near native performance. The Dart language is also giving a lot of possibilities to create really clean code. React Native deciding disadvantage was the need to make a lot of platform customizations.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Beautiful apps that looks the same one every platform\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- Flutter does not have any way to load views/widgets from JSON - we have to find a library which supports that\n- We have to put a lot of effort in the testing the app because we cannot deliver fixes via Hot Update features\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Flutter\n\n- Good, because Google is really caring about that project and there is also a plan to use it as a native language in upcoming FuchsiaOS\n- Good, because it does not depend on native components and looks everywhere the same\n- Good, because of Hot Reload & Hot Restart feature\n- Good, because Dart language is giving a lot possibilities to write clean code\n- Good, because of having a lot of actively developed packages\n- Good, because of active community\n- Bad, because it requires new language to learn\n- Bad, because there is no Hot Update feature\n- Bad, because it does not support natively loading views/widgets from the JSON\n- Bad, because of the slightly bigger build size\n\n### React Native\n\n- Good, because it only requires JS knowledge\n- Good, because React Components can be created from the JSON\n- Good, because of Hot Update feature\n- Good, because of Hot Reload & Hot Restart feature\n- Good, because of active community\n- Bad, because of depending on native platform components. In some cases apps possibilities will have to be reduced because of that and additionally the apps might looks differently\n- Bad, because of the worse performance\n\n## Links\n\n- https://doit.software/blog/flutter-vs-react-native#screen22"},"creationDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Crisperit","publicationDate":"2022-01-28T22:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"doc/decision/20220128-use-flutter-as-cross-platform-framework.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/prappser_app/prappser_app/doc/decision/20220128-use-flutter-as-cross-platform-framework.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/crisperit/prappser_app/blob/master/doc/decision/20220128-use-flutter-as-cross-platform-framework.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
