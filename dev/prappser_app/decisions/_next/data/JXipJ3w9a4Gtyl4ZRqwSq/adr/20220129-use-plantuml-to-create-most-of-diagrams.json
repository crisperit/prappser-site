We need some easy to use, in code solution for that. What should we choose?\n## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->\n\n- In file and text diagram\n- Easy to use\n- Easy to maintain\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- PlantUML\n- Draw.io\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"PlantUML\", because it allows to draw complicated diagrams with a bunch of text lines. It is easier to maintain text diagram cause we do not have to manually draw and move arrows etc. It is easier to maintain the same style across multiple of diagrams. It is also easier to solve any conflicting diagram changes. We should use \"PlantUML\" whenever we can and use \"Draw.io\" only when we cannot draw something in \"PlantUML\".\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### PlantUML\n\n- Good, because can be kept in text file\n- Good, because easy to use syntax\n- Good, because easy to perform change to the diagram\n- Good, because easy to solve conflicts\n- Bad, because less flexible than graphical solution\n\n### Draw.io\n\n- Good, because can be kept as a XML file\n- Good, because intuitive UI\n- Good, because of wide amount of possibilities\n- Bad, because hard to solve conflicts in the diagram\n- Bad, because time consuming to make the changes\n- Bad, because hard to ensure the same style across multiple of diagrams "},"creationDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Crisperit","publicationDate":"2022-01-29T22:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"doc/decision/20220129-use-plantuml-to-create-most-of-diagrams.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/prappser_app/prappser_app/doc/decision/20220129-use-plantuml-to-create-most-of-diagrams.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/crisperit/prappser_app/blob/master/doc/decision/20220129-use-plantuml-to-create-most-of-diagrams.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
