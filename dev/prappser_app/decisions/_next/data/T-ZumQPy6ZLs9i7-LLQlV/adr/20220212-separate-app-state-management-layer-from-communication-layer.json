Previously chosen at <AdrLink slug=\"20220130-make-user-communicate-via-their-shared-cloud-folders\" status=\"superseded\" title=\"Make user communicate via their shared cloud folders\" /> seems to be best in most of the cases, but we are worried about performance of such a method. Direct connection would be better than the one based on files listening. What should we do?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Flexibility\n- Free\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Separate app state management layer from communication layer\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Separate app state management layer from communication layer\", because it will give us possibility to propose multiple of communication methods to our users. We will be able to propose:\n- Shared cloud folders connection\n- LAN connection\n- Server connection\n- and other ideas...\n\nWe do not have to find the best for all cases communication method. We can just be able to propose multiple of solutions and let users find the best. It will be all possible thanks to code separation.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n- Users will be responsible for finding the best communication methods to their apps\n\n## Links\n\n- Supersedes <AdrLink slug=\"20220130-make-user-communicate-via-their-shared-cloud-folders\" status=\"superseded\" title=\"Make user communicate via their shared cloud folders\" />\n"},"creationDate":"2022-02-15T19:46:12.000Z","lastEditDate":"2022-02-15T19:46:12.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Krzysztof Perchlicki","publicationDate":"2022-02-12T22:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"doc/decision/20220212-separate-app-state-management-layer-from-communication-layer.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/prappser_app/prappser_app/doc/decision/20220212-separate-app-state-management-layer-from-communication-layer.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/crisperit/prappser_app/blob/master/doc/decision/20220212-separate-app-state-management-layer-from-communication-layer.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.0-beta.13"},"__N_SSG":true}
