One single PR can contains multiple of commits due to PR fixes. The commit mess can grow over time. In case of a need to revert one single feature it is much easier to revert single commit instead od ten of them. We have to ensure that we keep linear git history.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Easy to setup\n- Automatic - so that devs do not have to remember about it\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Squash restriction on PRs\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Squash restriction on PRs\", because it is easy to setup and it makes near impossible for PR creators to merge multiple requests to the main branch. Squash commit message prompt is also a good opportunity to set more clear commit message by a merger.\n\n## Links\n\n- https://www.bitsnbites.eu/a-tidy-linear-git-history/"},"creationDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Crisperit","publicationDate":"2022-01-30T22:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"doc/decision/20220130-keep-linear-git-history-via-squash-restriction.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/prappser_app/prappser_app/doc/decision/20220130-keep-linear-git-history-via-squash-restriction.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/crisperit/prappser_app/blob/master/doc/decision/20220130-keep-linear-git-history-via-squash-restriction.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.0-beta.13"},"__N_SSG":true}
