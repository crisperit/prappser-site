That means that we cannot keep any apps in the core build and also that we need some Flutter solution for defining the apps in a for of JSON.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Flexible\n- Actively maintained\n- Open for extensions\n- Allowing for creating dynamically changed actions\n\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- [json_dynamic_widget](https://pub.dev/packages/json_dynamic_widget)\n- [dynamic_widget](https://pub.dev/packages/dynamic_widget)\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"json_dynamic_widget\", because of the ability to define custom values & functions. The ability to subscribe for value stream as well as the overall possibilities of that library makes it a perfect fit for our needs. We also are contributing to that project because their growth is in our best interest.\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### json_dynamic_widget\n\n- Good, because it has flexible custom values & functions model\n- Good, because it is actively maintained\n- Good, because it allows to define dynamic actions like add, remove, edit via [json_dynamic_builder](https://github.com/peiffer-innovations/json_dynamic_widget/blob/main/lib/src/builders/json_dynamic_builder.dart)\n- Good, because we are contributing there\n- Bad, because there is no possibility to convert Flutter Widgets to JSON, they have to be manually written\n\n### dynamic_widget\n\n- Good, because has the ability to convert Flutter Widgets to JSON\n- Bad, because it is not open to extensions and their functionality is limited rather to just showing views and data"},"creationDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Crisperit","publicationDate":"2021-01-29T22:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"doc/decision/20220129-use-jsondynamicwidget-to-render-applications.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/prappser_app/prappser_app/doc/decision/20220129-use-jsondynamicwidget-to-render-applications.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/crisperit/prappser_app/blob/master/doc/decision/20220129-use-jsondynamicwidget-to-render-applications.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.0-beta.11"},"__N_SSG":true}
