Single form like `asset` will be better than `assets` because the single form is shorter and used by default in a generated project (lib, ios, test, web)."},"creationDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Crisperit","publicationDate":"2021-01-30T22:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"doc/decision/20220130-use-single-form-snake-case-for-package-names.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/prappser_app/prappser_app/doc/decision/20220130-use-single-form-snake-case-for-package-names.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/crisperit/prappser_app/blob/master/doc/decision/20220130-use-single-form-snake-case-for-package-names.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.0-beta.11"},"__N_SSG":true}
