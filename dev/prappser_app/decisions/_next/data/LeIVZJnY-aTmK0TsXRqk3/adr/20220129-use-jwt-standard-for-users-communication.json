Even if the link to that shared account will be passed only between two users - we have to ensure security even in case of stealing that link. How we can securely pass JSON events?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Payload size\n- Security\n- Library support\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Signed and encrypted JWT as described in [here](https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt/examples/signed-and-encrypted-jwt)\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Signed and encrypted JWT as described\", because it provides the best known security level. The JSON event is firstly signed (JWS) and then encrypted (JWE) and provides the best security level. We can think also about giving a choice for disabling the encryption part. Some users might want to prefer performance over security and we can give them a choice.\n\n## Links\n\n- Relates to <AdrLink slug=\"20220130-make-user-communicate-via-their-shared-cloud-folders\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Make user communicate via their shared cloud folders\" customLabel=\"Make user communicate via their shared cloud folders\" />"},"creationDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditDate":"2022-01-29T10:58:26.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Crisperit","publicationDate":"2021-01-29T22:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"doc/decision/20220129-use-jwt-standard-for-users-communication.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/prappser_app/prappser_app/doc/decision/20220129-use-jwt-standard-for-users-communication.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/crisperit/prappser_app/blob/master/doc/decision/20220129-use-jwt-standard-for-users-communication.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.0-beta.11"},"__N_SSG":true}
